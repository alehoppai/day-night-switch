# Day/Night switch

## Description

One evening I was scrolling instagram and found some funny video (I don't want to share it here because it was obviously repost or reupload and I want to grats only author of the original). So video was about Designer vs. Developer. Designer was chilling doing his job and developer was struggling doing his. And the original concept of switch they're working on hooked me up. So I wanted to challenge myself and Implement this switch with plane HTML/CSS as close as possible to the original as possible I could do. Unfortunately I don't have Figma-like design doc for this task so I work with all values on eye and with help of "Digital Colour Meter" MacOS app.
